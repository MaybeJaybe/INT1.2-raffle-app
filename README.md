<h1>raffl.it</h1>
raffl.it is something I created as the answer to a more streamlined raffle that can be used flexibly.

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
Type in any name or info and click the + button to add it to the list. Each item can be removed by clicking the - button. 
When the list is complete, click the raffle button and it will display which of the list has won! Pretty straightforward if I do say so myself.
